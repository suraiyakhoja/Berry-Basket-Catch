Rules of the game:

Try to collect as many fruits in the basket as you can. For every fruit you collide with, you earn 50 points.
Avoid the leaves! If you collide with a leaf, you lose 25 points.
If you collect a power up (a flower) the speed of your basket increases for 15 seconds so you can collect fruits faster. 

Uniqueness:
I implemented a way to keep track of the score and display it. 
I also created another function in Unit that takes extra parameters and checks for overlapping items that are falling from the top of the game window. I did this to avoid items falling from the same coordinates.
